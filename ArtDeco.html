    <h3 style="text-align: center;font-size:180%">1. Four-bedroom 1930s art deco property in Southgate, London N14 (pictured above)</h3><br>
    <p style="font-size: 150%;color:rgb(47, 41, 41)">We featured something similar in the same area back in 2012. But this is definitely a completely different four-bedroom 1930s art deco property in Southgate, London N14.But much of it (modern kitchen aside) is just decor and fittings. So don’t let that put you off too much.As for space, there are four bedrooms, a double reception room, a study / reception room, a modern fitted kitchen, bathroom and guest WC. You also get a large roof terrace, a 91ft rear garden and ‘ample’ off-street parking.<br><br><span style="color: rgb(75, 70, 70);"> Offers over £800,00 for this.<br>Minimum land required to this design is 1000 sq ft.</span></p><br><br>

        <h3 style="text-align: center;font-size:180%">2. Unrestored 1930s art deco property in Mildenhall, Suffolk</h3><br>
        <p style="font-size: 150%;color:rgb(47, 41, 41)">If there is one thing we know our readers love, it is unrestored art deco properties. This one isn’t exactly untouched, but much of this 1930s art deco property in Mildenhall, Suffolk is faithful to the original design.The overall look, the windows, the fireplaces and the room layouts all present a rather nice canvas for someone who wants to take this place on and perhaps return it to its former glory or update into a stylish modern home. You could always do both. The two work hand in hand.Head in and you’ll find an entrance hall, which takes you to the living and dining room with lovely wrap-around windows and what looks like an original fireplace. There is also access to the large kitchen with multiple storage cupboards, a pantry cupboard, under-stairs cupboard and a door leading to rear hallway plus a door to the garden. Other space on this floor is a secondary reception room and downstairs bathroom / wet room.Head upstairs and you will find the master bedroom, again with the original windows and fireplace, a further bedroom and a family bathroom.       <br><br><span style="color: rgb(75, 70, 70);"> Offers over £950,00 for this.<br>Minimum land required to this design is 1100 sq ft.</span></p><br><br>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;font-size:180%">3.Three-bedroom 1930s art deco property in Gidea Park, Romford</h3><br>
            <p style="font-size: 150%;color:rgb(47, 41, 41)">Yes, not the biggest or boldest art deco house in the country, but this one has been maintained and renovated to a very high standard. The end product is a house that will be just perfect for fans of the look or the era.On the face of it, this is an art deco-styled property with three bedrooms, a bathroom, a separate WC, two reception rooms, a fitted kitchen, a good-sized rear garden, an attached garage and its own drive. But the devil in in the detail here.All rooms have there original picture rails and cornices and any modern features have been ‘carefully researched in order to try to replicate the original features of the house’, including modern bakelite light switches and plug sockets. The interior door fittings and wall lights are all original bakelite too.The living room has a feature fireplace and original alcove detailing/features, likewise the dining room has its original fireplace too. The kitchen has an English Rose kitchen (which is retro rather than art deco), the original staircase remains, original fireplaces have been found and reused in the bedrooms and the bathroom has an original art deco sink and taps.

            <h3 style="text-align: center;font-size:180%">4. 1930s Blenkinsopp and Scratchard-designed art deco property in Castleford, Yorkshire</h3><br>
            <p style="font-size: 150%;color:rgb(47, 41, 41);">The surprising thing with this house is the number of period details that are still in place. No one is pretending this is some kind of 1930s time capsule, but it does have more originality than your average art deco house on the market.The architecture has certainly been looked after over the decades. The angles and the curves, the central tower, the balcony and of course, the roof terrace. This is a building you really cannot take your eyes off. I don’t know if those railings are original or a modern interpretation, but in black, they really do add a wonderful finishing touch. Likewise the windows in this place.On that front, I am talking about details like a number of the internal doors (and door handles), parquet flooring, the curved hallway, that amazing bath and of course, the roof terrace space.But the modern era is also a key part of the interior too. A wander through this place shows a large and modern kitchen area, an updated second bathroom and plenty of modern-era decoration. As I said, this is no time capsule, but take away the bold wallpaper, add in a more era-neutral kitchen and update the furnishings and you won’t be too far away from the original era. As ever, it’s all down to personal taste when it comes to an interior and that is something you can change fairly easily.

            <p style="font-size: 150%;color:rgb(47, 41, 41);">You might recall it because I featured it a few times on the site some years ago. In short, it was up for sale on several occasions and looking for a buyer for the best part of a few years.There is so much to talk about once you get inside this one. There’s much to talk about when it comes to the architecture and exterior too. This is the art deco dream for someone with the mix of curves and straight lines, the balconies, the roof terrace and of course, the Crittall glazing.As for the rest of the house, a gated walkway takes you through the walled garden, through the primary entrance and into the entrance hall and a solid parquet floor.Two ‘generous’ reception rooms are on the ground floor. To the immediate right are a ‘light-filled’ living room with a wall of curved, Crittall bay windows and a decoratively tiled working fireplace offering a focal point for the room.An adjacent dining room has similar details. but looks out onto the rear garden. A good-sized and very original kitchen too, complete with an interconnected larder and store and a tiled alcove with space for a cooker or Aga.The third bedroom is smaller in size, with a small study also on this level as well as a bathroom and WC that still has its original 1930’s fixtures, fittings and black-edged Vitrolite tiling.
